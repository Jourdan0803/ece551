Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 Story.o Page.o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c Story.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c Page.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o Story.o Page.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 Story.o Page.o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c Story.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -c Page.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o Story.o Page.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2
------------------------------------
